## Installation

First [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository or dowload it (click on 'code' button and then click on the Download Zip option), then unzip the compressed file and open the main folder where you will find the backend and frontend folders, we need to install the packages for both frontend and backend in their respective folders so first let's go to the backend folder, open this location in your terminal and install the packages:

```bash
  cd backend
  npm install
```

Now move back and go to the frontend folder and install packages there:

```bash
  cd ..
  cd frontend
  npm install
```

The database used is mongodb and is already hosted on the mongodb website so you do not need to install or configure it 


## Structure

  npm run dev
```
